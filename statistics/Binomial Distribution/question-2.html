           <p>A popular computer card game keeps track of the number of games played and the number of games won on that
            computer. The cards are shuffled before each game, so the outcome of the game is independent from one game
            to the next and is based on the skill of the player. Let \(X\) represent the number of games that have been won out
            of 100 games. Under which of the following situations would \(X\) be a binomial random variable?</p>
