           <p> A machine is designed to dispense at least 12 ounces of a beverage into a bottle. To test whether the machine is
            working properly, a random sample of 50 bottles was selected and the mean number of ounces for the 50 bottles
            was computed. A test of the hypotheses \(H_0 : \mu=12\) versus \(H_a : \mu \lt 12\) was conducted, where \(\mu\) represents
            the population mean number of ounces of the beverage dispensed per bottle by the machine. The \(p\)-value for the
            test was 0.08. Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion to draw at the significance level of
            \(\alpha\) = 0.05 ?</p>
