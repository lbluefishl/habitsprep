            <p>A boxplot displays the range of text messages sent. However, a boxplot is actually unnecessary here since this question refers to the number of students rather than the number of texts.</p>
            <p>The first quartile represents the 25th percentile and the third quartile the 75th percentile. The number of students from the minimum to the 
                first quartile is approximately 25%. The the number of students from the median (50th percentile) to the third quartile (75th percentile) is also 25 percent. </p>
