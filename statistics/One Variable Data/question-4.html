<p>Three brands of candy pieces—X, Y, and Z—are made in many colors. Shaela bought one bag of each brand
    and counted the number of pieces of each color. The graph below shows the relative frequency distribution of
    colors for each bag.</p>

<p>We are given only the frequencies of the bags. 
    Therefore, we cannot make any judgement about the exact number of candies between bags. 
    However, in any given bag, we can compare relative proportions of each color. 
    In Brand Y, the the red bar (~50%) definately is larger than the green bar (~30%).</p>
