           <p>In a recent survey, 60 randomly selected married couples from the same town were asked to rate the overall
            quality of living in their town on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent) on twenty different attributes such
            as accessibility to major highways, availability of entertainment, services provided by tax dollars, etc. For each
            couple, the husband's individual ratings on the twenty attributes were averaged to produce an overall quality
            rating, and that process was repeated for the wife. Each point on the scatterplot below displays the overall rating
            of one of the 60 couples with the husband's rating represented by the horizontal axis and the wife's rating
            represented by the vertical axis.</p>
