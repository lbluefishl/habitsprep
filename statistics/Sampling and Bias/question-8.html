           <p>A survey was administered to parents of high school students in a certain state to see if the parents thought the
            students' academic needs were being met. To select the sample, the parents were divided into two groupsâ€”
            one group of parents who live in cities with populations of more than 100,000 and the other group of parents
            who live in cities with populations less than or equal to 100,000. A random sample of 100 parents from each
            group was taken. Which of the following statements about the sample of 200 parents is true?</p>
