           <p>A large clinical trial was designed to determine whether a certain vitamin improves the general health of adults.
            The investigators first identified 85 variables that measure various aspects of the general health of adults.
            Because each adult in the clinical trial was to serve as his or her own control, the 85 variables were measured for
            each adult, both before taking the vitamin and after taking the vitamin for three months. The investigators then
            performed 85 matched-pair \(t\)-tests, one for each variable. They found statistically significant results at the 0.05
            level in 2 of the variables, both in the direction of improved general health. Which of the following should the
            investigators conclude?</p>

                    There is evidence that the vitamin improves the health of adults because 2 of the 85 tests were statistically
                    significant.

typically underestimate the proportion of the population that is helped by a vitamin.

                    level, one could easily get statistically significant results in 2 out of 85 tests just due to chance variability.

            <p>Out of the 85 health variables, only 2 were significant. It is unlikely the vitamin is effective since the other 83 variables were unchanged. </p>
            <p>The last choice may seem tempting, but there can be odd number of variables in a matched-pairs design. An individual was tested before the drug and after taking the drug for each variable.</p>
