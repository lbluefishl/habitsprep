           <p> In high school, it did not seem to make a
            difference how much Clive studied Spanish;
            he always earned poor grades. Now that Clive
            is in college, he is required to take Spanish again.
            According to the concept of learned helplessness,
            which of the following statements can be most
            expected from Clive as he starts the new
            Spanish class?</p>
