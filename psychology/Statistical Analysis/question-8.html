<p> An instructor conducted an experiment to determine the effects of two different methods of study
    on the amount students learned in introductory
    physics. The results showed that the average
    amount learned by the group using one method
    was greater than the average amount learned by
    the group using the other. However, the difference
    was not statistically significant. Which of the
    following is the most appropriate conclusion to be
    drawn?</p>
