           <p>A group of students designed an experiment
            to determine the effect of compost on the
            germination and growth of plants. The students
            set up experimental plots by mixing different
            ratios of soil and compost. They planted 20 pea
            and 20 melon seeds in each plot and watered each
            plot regularly. The students recorded the number
            of seeds that germinated, and as the plants grew,
            they recorded plant length, number and size of
            leaves, and general health observations.</p>
<p>The following observations were recorded.</p>
<ul style="line-height: 2;">
    <li>In all treatments, more pea seeds
        germinated than melon seeds.</li>
<li>There was a week of rainy weather at
    three weeks.</li>
    <li>Melon plants developed a fungal growth at
        four weeks.</li>
        <li>Melon plants grew longer than pea plants,
            but many melon leaves showed signs of
            yellowing as the weeks passed.</li>
</ul>
                     <p>The students concluded that pea plants grew
                        better in compost than did melon plants.</p>
                        <p>Which of the following best addresses the validity
                            of the conclusion made by the students?</p>

            <p>For a scientific experiment to be valid and lead to a conclusion such as causation, it needs to be controlled. There should only be one manipulated (independent) variable.
                To compare growth rates, we need to make sure all other variables are held constant. Since fungus appeared in the melon plots, we do not know whether the melon would have grown faster if the fungus was absent.
            </p>
            <p>A large sample size may lead to more confidence of the results, but it does not mean the experiment is controlled.</p>
            <p>Units of measurement are important, but does not change the general premise of the experiment.</p>
