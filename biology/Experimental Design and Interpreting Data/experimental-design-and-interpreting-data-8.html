<p>Water in a pond contaminated with the
    weed killer atrazine is suspected of inhibiting
    metamorphosis in northern leopard frogs.
    A team of scientists collected fertilized northern
    leopard frog eggs from a different pond that is not
    contaminated. Which of the following is the best
    experimental design to determine whether atrazine
    is responsible for inhibiting metamorphosis in
    northern leopard frogs?</p>

<p>For a controlled experiment, we require a control group and an experimental group. 
    We should only manipulate one variable. In this case, it should be the absence or presence of the chemical atrazine. 
    All other variables are held constant.</p>
