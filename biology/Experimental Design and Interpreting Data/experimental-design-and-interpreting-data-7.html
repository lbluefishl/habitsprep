           <p>Ethylene is an organic compound produced by
            ripening fruits. In a controlled experiment,
            researchers found that ethylene gas stimulated
            the ripening process in newly harvested fruits.
            Which of the following describes the most likely
            connection between natural ethylene production
            and fruit ripening?</p>

            <p>In the experiment, the gas stimulated ripening in newly harvested fruit. This implies that the gas stimulates 
                ripening at any stage, since newly harvested fruit may not have been ready to ripen on their own.
                The gas is a chemical signal that interacts with fruit. We can expect that in normal circumstances, a ripening fruit 
                producing the signal would trigger nearby fruits to ripen.

            <p>The processes described are exactly what happens in your home. That is why a bunch of bananas may seem to be unripe for a long period, but 
                through the positive feedback process, they seem to ripen and spoil in just a couple of days. One way to slow the speed of ripening is separating fruit.
