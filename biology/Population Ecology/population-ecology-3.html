<p>Chytridiomycosis is a potentially lethal fungal infection that adversely affects some frog populations. The
    incidence and severity of the fungal infection can vary over time. Which of the following statements best
    describes the changes in the frog population that are depicted in the model above?</p>

                    Based on the trend over the past few years of the study, the fungus has become extinct.

                    Infected individuals gradually died out, and genetically resistant individuals became more common.
The frog population recovered because of the increased frequency of resistant individuals.

                    The size of the frog population decreased sharply upon initial contact with the fungus. The fungus
                    eventually became symbiotic with individual frogs, and the frog population began to recover.

            Initially, the population size of the frog was large. As more frogs became infected, 
            the population size decreased, since the infection is lethal. Over time, the frog population
             returned to normal and the frequency of infection decreased.
            One likely explanation of this is that the frogs developed resistance since surviving individuals were able to pass on their genes.
           <p>It is unlikely that a virus switches from lethal to harmless. </p>
           <p>It is possible that the virulency increased, but individual frogs do not evolve. Natural variation in the frogs may have conferred resistance to specific individuals, and the population of frogs developed resistance over time since those frogs passed on their genes conferring resistance. </p> 
     <p>Viruses normally do not become symbiotic with their hosts.</p>
