           <p>Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is important in maintaining
            homeostasis in mammals. ADH is released from the
            hypothalamus in response to high tissue osmolarity. In
            response to ADH, the collecting duct and distal tubule in the
            kidney become more permeable to water, which increases
            water reabsorption into the capillaries. The amount of
            hormone released is controlled by a negative feedback loop.</p>
<p>Based on the model presented, which of the following
    statements expresses the proper relationship between
    osmolarity, ADH release, and urine production?</p>

            <p>The question mentions that ADH is released when the tissue osmolarity is high. ADH causes water reabsorption into the capillaries (blood vessels). This implies that water is kept in the blood instead of excreted with urine.</p>
      <p>This is reasonable, since when the concentration of solutes is high, water tends to leave the cells. The negative feedback response is necessary to conserve water when cells are in hypertonic solutions.</p>
