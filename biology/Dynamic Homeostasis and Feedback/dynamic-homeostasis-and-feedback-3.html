           <p><i>Anabaena</i> is a simple multicellular photosynthetic cyanobacterium. In the absence of fixed nitrogen, certain

            newly developing cells along a filament express genes that code for nitrogen-fixing enzymes and become non-photosynthetic heterocysts. The specialization is advantageous because some nitrogen-fixing enzymes function
            
            best in the absence of oxygen. Heterocysts do not carry out photosynthesis but instead provide adjacent cells
            with fixed nitrogen, in exchange receiving fixed carbon and reduced energy carriers.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="3.jpg"></div>
                     <p>As shown in the diagram above, when there is low fixed nitrogen in the environment, an increase in the
                        concentration of free calcium ions and 2-oxyglutarate stimulates the expression of genes that produce
                        two transcription factors (NtcA and HetR) that promote the expression of genes responsible for heterocyst
                        development. HetR also causes production of a signal, PatS, that prevents adjacent cells from developing as
                        heterocysts.</p>
                        <p>Based on your understanding of the ways in which signal transmission mediates cell function, which of the
                            following predictions is most consistent with the information given above?</p>

            <p>In an environment with low fixed nitrogen, free calcium concentration increases and leads to an increase in 
                NtcA and HetR. If a calcium-binding compound is added, the free calcium concentration would not increase since it would bind with the compound. 
            This leads to reduced NtcA and HetR production, which subsequently results in reduced Heterocyst development.</p>
            <p>If <i>patS</i> is overexpressed, there should be increased inhibition of heterocyst development, meaning less heterocysts.</p>
      <p>When nitrogen is abundant, free calcium would not be high. </p>
      <p>Loss of hetR means less heterocyst development.</p>
