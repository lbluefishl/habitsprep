<p>The Stanley Miller apparatus demonstrated that
    organic molecules could assemble spontaneously
    in an environment lacking free oxygen and
    containing water, methane, and ammonia in the
    presence of an abundant energy source, such as an
    electric discharge. The research was considered
    supportive of the organic soup hypothesis, which
    states that the primitive atmosphere provided
    inorganic precursors from which organic
    molecules could have been synthesized in the
    presence of an energy source. Based on
    subsequent research, the primordial atmosphere
    was determined to contain less methane and more
    carbon dioxide. The new data about the
    composition of the early atmosphere had which of
    the following effects on origin-of-life hypotheses?</p>

<p>Scientists don't typically fully discard or abandon old theories. 
    Old theories may be refuted, but they may still be important in providing evidence or information for a better theory.
The question mentions that the gases are still present, only differing in quantity. 
A new hypothesis can be amended using new tests which alter the quantities of the gas molecules.</p>
