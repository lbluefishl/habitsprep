           <p>High blood cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia,
            HC) can lead to cardiovascular problems such
            as atherosclerosis and heart attack. Exercise and
            monitoring of diet can often control cholesterol
            levels; however, in certain cases HC is inherited
            as an autosomal dominant disease caused by
            a mutation in a single gene.</p>
<p>A man with high cholesterol levels is about to
    marry a woman whose total cholesterol levels
    are also higher than average. A physician has
    suggested they get tested for the \(HC\) allele.
    Which of the following is a valid ethical
    question concerning the test?</p>

            <p>Many medical test results may lead to ethical issues, which involve questions of right or wrong. A controversial issue is that of health care premiums. If insurance companies have access to medical records, is it ethical to make more money from these people knowing they are at greater risk of getting sick?</p>
     <p>Health, diet, and exercise aren't ethical issues by themselves.</p>
