           <p>The tiny blue-eyed Mary flower is often one of
            the first flowers seen in the spring in some regions
            of the United States. The flower is normally blue,
            but sometimes a white or pink flower variation is
            found.</p>
<p>The following data were obtained after several
    crosses.</p>

              <p>Which of the following statements best explains
                the data?</p>

                    The appearance of blue in the F<sub>1</sub> generation
                    of the pink and white cross demonstrates
                    that flower color is not an inherited trait but
                    is determined by the environment.

                    Flower color depends on stages of flower
development, and young flowers are white,
advancing to pink and then blue.

                    Since the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> phenotypes of the pink
                    and white cross do not fit the expected
                    genotypic and phenotypic ratios, blue-eyed
                    Mary must reproduce by vegetative
                    propagation.

                    Flower color is an inherited trait, and the F<sub>1</sub>
                    and F<sub>2</sub> phenotypes of the flowers arising
                    from the pink and white cross can best be
                    explained by another gene product that
                    influences the phenotypic expression.

<p>We can eliminate the first three choices.</p>

<p>If flower color were determined by the environment, we would not see the 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the first two crosses.  </p>
<p>There is no evidence that the stages of the flowers were considered in the crosses. Again, the 3:1 ratio highlights an inheritance pattern characteristic of a simple mendelian cross between a heterozygous and homozygous individual.</p>
<p>Vegetative propogation is a form of asexual reproduction, and we would expect parental generations to have the same phenotype of the offspring.</p>
<p>The evidence points to an interited trait. There does seem to be some interaction with another gene to obtain the results in the 3rd cross.</p>
