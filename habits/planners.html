        <p class="center-paragraph">A planner is a common tool given to most students. Many common problems can be overcome through the proper use of a planner. 
            Calendars are useful as well, but any simple planner which includes each day of the week is satisfactory.

            <h2>Written Declarations</h2>
 <p>Simply writing down intentions can lead to a huge boost in completion. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.54.7.493" target="_blank">Studies</a> show that by relying on willpower alone, goals are rarely completed. Think New Years Resolutions. But by doing simple things such as creating a checklist can lead to much higher rates of goal completion.  </p>

 <p>To increase the probability of completition of a task, additional, specific information can be added. These include the exact time the activity is to be completed, where it is to be done, and how it will be done. We don't really need to do this for day to day plans, but for larger projects or assignments these options are important.</p>

            <h2>Anxiety and Procrastination Reduction</h2>
<p>From my experience, scheduling helps students because it frees up working memory from stressful, intrusive thoughts. Students that don't consolidate their tasks into a planner are forced to think about what they need to do constantly. It may also foster procrastination, since the student may want to do a task, but perhaps its not the correct time to do so. For example, a student may be trying to sleep, but feels anxious about preparing for a test a few days away. </p>

<p>So, instead of</p>

<i>“Which classes do I have homework for? Do I have math homework? What page was it? I didn't really get it at all. I have that project that I really need to do. Should I start writing my draft for English? My mom is going to kill me if I fail the next math test. I gotta go out with my friends soon, when's the assignment deadline? What do I need to do tomorrow before my friend's birthday party? How long should I study bio for? Do I need to do that extra credit assignment? I have to eat dinner but what should I do after? Should I do this today or tomorrow? Maybe in the morning? I really can't fall asleep…</i>
    
<p>We just need to:</p>
<i>Check the planner.</i>

                <h2>Autonomy </h2>
    
                <p>Several <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220973.1991.10806579" target="_blank">studies</a> have shown that when students make decisions, free of outside pressure, they are much more likely to be completed. Planners give students a chance to dictate what they do each day. Generally, most individuals complete things that they started, but are less likely to complete tasks that others want them to do.</p>
                <p>It is important that the student uses the planner at their own discretion. A student should not be forced to add certain events. A planner should not be done by the parents or third parties. </p>

Since a student should check the planner when he or she is ready to work, this should also reduce procrastination since tasks are not delayed from sporadic, individual thoughts. </p>
