            Long term motivation for students is a bit more subtle, but can be broken down into three main influences.

                <h2>Broken Windows Theory</h2>
                <p>From 2004 to 2006, Stephen B. Plank and colleagues from Johns Hopkins University conducted a
                    correlational <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/595669" target="_blank">study</a> to determine the degree to which the physical appearance of the school
                    and classroom setting influence student behavior, particularly in respect to the variables
                    concerned in their study: fear, social disorder, and collective efficacy.
                    They collected survey data administered to 6th-8th students by 33 public schools in a large
                    mid-Atlantic city.
                    From analyses of the survey data, the researchers determined that the variables in their
                    study
                    are statistically significant to the physical conditions of the school and classroom
                    setting. </p>

                <p><i>...the findings of the current study suggest that educators and researchers should be vigilant
                        about factors that influence student perceptions of climate and safety. Fixing broken windows
                        and attending to the physical appearance of a school cannot alone guarantee productive teaching
                        and learning, but ignoring them likely greatly increases the chances of a troubling downward
                        spiral.</i></p>

                <h2>Group Composition</h2>
                <p> A <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w7867" target="_blank">report</a> from Caroline Hoxby suggest that having a more female peer group raises both male and
                    female scores in reading and math.
                    To identify true peer effects, Hoxby compares groups within a given school that differ randomly in
                    peer composition. She controls other common variables, such as home environment and student
                    achievement.
                    One of her results suggested that having a more female peer group raises both male and female
                    scores in reading and math.
                    She points out that only some of the "good" peer effect of females can be direct learning spillovers
                    because females do not know math better than males on average, although they are better readers. The
                    fact that females raise math scores, therefore, must be due to phenomena more general than direct
                    learning spillovers -- for instance, females' lower tendency to disrupt.</p>

            <p class="center">Small differences can accumulate and undergo exponential change over the course
                of many years.
                Studies like the ones suggest cryptic influences on behavior. For example, a poorly maintained class may
                be detrimental to motivation.
                Having male tablemates may result in dramatically different scores in math than having female
                tablemates.
                Many of these variables are beyond our control, but we should be aware of their influence.

            <p style="text-align:left; padding: 1em 10em;">A student's efficacy (effectiveness) in doing a certain task will influence behavior. Typically, individuals are motivated to do tasks that are a little more difficult than they can normally handle. Anything too easy or too difficult will each correspond to poor motivation.
                In addition, a student's perception of their efficacy also plays a large role in motivation. 
                Even if a student is capable of doing a task, their perception of their ability may influence and produce 
                negative results.

                <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
                <p> Are women worse at math than men? Not necessarily, research shows, but there sure is a generalization about it. 
                    A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103198913737" target="_blank" >study</a> explored whether the perception of gender differences could affect mathematical ability. 
                    The studies found that differences in performance 
                    could be eliminated when stereotype threat was lowered by 
                    describing the test as not producing gender differences. 
                    However, when the test was described as producing gender
                     differences and stereotype threat was high, women performed 
                     substantially worse than equally qualified men did.

                <p>Similarly disheartening <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40063382" target="_blank">studies</a> showed similar results with race. Subjects who were primed (exposed) to racial prejudices (asians are better at this type of math)
                     before a math test performed significantly worse. Conversely, scores increased for individuals who conform to the stereotypes were exposed prior to assessment compared to similar individuals who were not exposed.</p>

                    An <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40196120" target="_blank">analysis</a> showed that the reasons students identify for their previous successes and failures may be an important determinant of expectancies, and therefore, motivation. 
                    Students who attribute their success to internal or controllable causes (their talents, abilities, 
                    persistence, or effort) are more likely to obtain success than students who attribute success or failure to external or uncontrollable causes ("I'm bad at math"). 
                    Simply changing the attribution from "I'm not a good writer" to "I should have prepared more" helps keep motivation high.

                Value falls into three broad categories. The first is attainment value, or satisfaction of completing or mastering something. Another is intrinsic value, which represents satisfaction from simply doing a task. The last is extrinsic value, which involve things like grades, money, or fame. These three often work in parallel. 
                Students may be first influenced by extrinsic rewards but find out they really like doing a task (intrinsic). When completing it they obtain a sense of accomplishment (attainment) which spurs similar activity. 
                Extrinsic value is the realm most heavily influenced. Let's take a look at some relevant studies.

                <h2>Threats and Punishment</h2>
                <p>
                    Here's an old, but important <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022103165900429" target="_blank">study</a>. Jonathan Freedman investigated whether threats could produce long-term behavioral effects.  
                    Children were told not to play with a very 
                    desirable toy under high or low threat, and were left alone with the toy. A high threat would be something like, "If you play with the robot, I'll be very angry and will have to do something about it." A low threat would be, "It is wrong to play with the robot." In both cases, children initially resisted playing with the toy, irregardless of its severity of threat. No surprise here.
                      </p>
                     
                     <p>6 weeks later, the children came back and had a chance to do unrelated activities in the absence of the experimenter. Children that had initially been in the high threat group were much more likely to play with the previously forbidden toy then the students in the low threat group. 
                  
                </p>
                <p>What are the implications of the study? Threats work in the short term. In the long term, stronger threats will negatively affect behavior. Some researchers have commented that when decisions are made by students themselves, they are much more likely to be followed. Threats work, but they support a notion that behavior should only be done when associated with a threat. When the threat is removed, the behavior would resume. It is possible that punishment follows similar routes; they work when implemented, but result in poor long term habits or independent functioning.</p>

                <h2>Reward</h2>
                <p>
                    Generally, reinforcement has been shown to help learning outcomes. But like with all good things, they come with the bad. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00346543071001001" target="_blank">Studies</a> have shown that extrinsic rewards, tangible rewards like stickers, pizza parties, student awards, may reduce intrinsic motivation. Studies have shown that strong intrinsic motivation is linked to high-quality learning and adjustment.
                    Similar to punishment, students may begin to associate working hard with the reward and not the process of learning itself.
