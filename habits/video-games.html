        Video games get a bad rep because of their associations with many bad behaviors. In my experience, video games are fine when moderated. They may actually infer several important benefits. However, most of the time, video games are not played in moderation. The time invested into video games unfortunately affects other habits, primarily sleep and the learning environment.

            <h2>Video Games and Intelligence</h2>
<p>A recent 2022 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11341-2" target="_blank">study</a> showed a significant association between video games and intelligence. The cognitive benefits of video games are backed by other studies and make intuitive sense; video games require active engagement and practice. Video games improve visual-spatial processing, critical thinking, problem-solving, and some social skills. </p>

<p>More recently, game companies have tended to engage in more predatory behaviors. Some of these include the need to include more addictive systems (daily rewards, fear of missing out tactics, and social pressure). Adolescents are vulnerable to these tactics and will undoubtedly end up attached to these predatory games compared to games that can be enjoyed moderately and provide more varied intelligence benefits.  </p>
