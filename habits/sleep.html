            <h2>Effects of Sleep Loss</h2>
            <p> In one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2963797/" target="_blank">study</a>, one
                group of adolescents was subjected to sleep deprivation (6.5 hours) vs a control (10 hours). The group
                that was sleep deprived showed significantly lower quiz scores, more inattentive behaviors, and lower
                arousal. In addition, sleep is crucial for encoding short-term memories into the long-term ones.

            <p>Other <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780444537027000075"
                    target="_blank">studies</a> have shown that sleep deprivation reduces creative functions and
                divergent thinking. Why does this affect learning so much?
                Learning is the process of consolidating new rules and ideas. Creative thinking is crucial for
                integrating new ideas into existing preconceptions. The study points out that although stimulants
                (caffeine) may restore certain cognitive systems that relate to alertness and attention, other important
                systems such as those for creativity may not be restored. </p>

            <p> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255771"
                    target="_blank">Studies</a> have attempted to measure how long it takes to recover from just a few
                hours of sleep deprivation. Just a few hours of sleep deprivation on one day could take multiple full
                days of normal sleep to recover from. For adolescents, this is especially troubling, since they
                frequently go many days of sleep deprivation, which may take up to a month to recover from. </p>
            <p>Individuals may try to recover their sleep on weekends (sleep compensation), but the results from the
                research indicate that a few days are not enough. </p>

            <h2>Chronic Sleep Deprivation</h2>
            <p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12683469/" target="_blank">study</a> has shown that chronic
                deprivation can lead to adaptations in which a person may feel like they are not sleepy even though
                their body shows significant declines in physical and mental performance. Therefore a student may feel
                like they are fine when in reality their cognitive functions have been severely impaired. </a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079205001231"
                    target="_blank">Studies</a> have emphasized that sleep deprivation disproportionally affects the
                prefrontal cortex (pFC). Long term neglect of this region can result in long term behavioral changes
                that are difficult to reverse. Among other functions, pFC is responsible for complex cognitive behavior,
                personality expression, decision making, and moderating social behavior. The development of the pFC
                occurs primarily during adolescence up till the mid 20s.</p>

                <p class="ta">Sleep loss corresponds to a range of negative consequences. Attention and learning are
                    significantly affected by sleep deprivation. Stimulants may restore alertness, but not other brain
                    functions.</p>

                    Create a consistent sleep schedule. Do not rely on stimulants (energy drinks,

                <p class="ta">It takes much more time to recuperate from sleep loss than one might think. A few hours of sleep loss requires several days of regular sleep to fix.</p>

                   Sleep at the same time each day. Do not expect to restore function by "making up" sleep on the weekends or holidays.

                   Be careful of statements like "I don't feel sleepy". A body can adapt to sleep deprivation by lowering cognitive function. A normal adolescent should get around 9 hours of sleep each night.
