                The student council of a certain high school of 500 students plans to conduct a survey to determine the best location for the activities building. Of the following sampling methods, which is most likely
                to yield results that best represent all the students' preferences?

            <p>
            We want to find the sample that is most representative of all of the students at the high school. 
            </p>
            <p>An online survey would not be sufficient because not everyone may know of or have access to the school website. There is also self-selection bias, in which students volunteer to do the survey rather than being randomly selected.</p>
            <p>Not all students use the school library, so the sample would be biased.</p>
            <p>Similarly, not every student buys school lunch. We would be missing certain student types if our survey was conduced this way. </p>
            <p>Since all students take classes, surveying a random number of students from each class would provide the best representation of all students. Generally, the number of classes is quite large at most schools, so the sample size would be suitable as well. </p>
