           <p>A student is recording a song on her computer. When the recording is finished, she saves a copy on her computer. The student notices 
               that the saved copy is of lower sound quality than the original recording. Which of the following could be a possible explanation for the difference 
               in sound quality?

<p>Since bits represent information, less bits means less information was recorded and therefore the song was of lower-quality. A lossless compression technique would result in no loss of quality (or bits). When data is saved to another location on the computer, it is duplicated with no change in quality.</p>
