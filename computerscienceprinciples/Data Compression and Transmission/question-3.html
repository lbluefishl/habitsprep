           <p>Digital images are often represented by the red, green, and blue values (an RGB triplet) of each individual pixel in
            the image. A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image. Which of the
            following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image?</p>

                    assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. The new value of each pixel represents
                    a shade of gray, ranging from white to black.

                    light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.

            <p>A lossless transformation implies no loss of information. We should be able to transform it back to normal. Compressing the image fundamentally results in the loss of information. Averaging the RGB values also results in the loss of information since we can not go from the averaged values back to the RGB values. If we copy and replace pixels, some pixel information is lost.  </p>

            <p>Creating a negative of an image by subtracting each RGB value by 255 can be reversed by simply adding 255 to the modified values.</p>
