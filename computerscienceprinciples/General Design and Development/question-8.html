           <p>A certain computer game is played between a human player and a computer-controlled player. Every time the
            computer-controlled player has a turn, the game runs slowly because the computer evaluates all potential moves
            and selects the best one. Which of the following best describes the possibility of improving the running speed of
            the game?</p>

                    The game's running speed can only be improved if the game is played between two human players instead of
                    with the computer-controlled player.

                    The game's running speed might be improved by using a process that finds approximate solutions every time
the computer-controlled player has a turn.
