           <p>Many Web browsers allow users to open anonymous windows. During a browsing session in an anonymous
            window, the browser does not record a browsing history or a list of downloaded files. When the anonymous
            window is exited, cookies created during the session are deleted. Which of the following statements about browsing
            sessions in an anonymous window is true?</p>

<p>In anonymous browsing, things like cookies and browsing history are not saved. For example, on this website, you would not be able to track your progress if you used it in private mode.</p>
<p>Individuals who monitor your network can still see which sites you visited (if they bothered to). You can still go to all websites and log in, though it would not save your login if you closed the window. Viruses will work the same way since private browsing does not provide any additional protection.</p>
